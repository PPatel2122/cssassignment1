        <h2><i>What is css?</i></h2>

        <p>1.CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</p>
        <p>2.CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</p>
        <p>3.<span class="cut">CSS is not necessary</span><span class="color"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
        <p><i>4.<span class="un">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</span></i></p>

        <H2><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></H2>

        <ul id="space">
            <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
            <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="co">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
